# Lifespan_countdown

This code is a Python script for creating a life expectancy countdown app using Tkinter. The app starts the countdown after the user enters his/her date of birth and estimated lifespan, and displays the time remaining until the estimated lifespan.

The application functions as follows

The user is presented with a field for entering the date of birth and a field for entering the estimated life expectancy. After the user enters the year, month, day, and estimated lifespan, the "Start" button is clicked. The Lifetime Countdown window will appear, displaying the time remaining from the current date and time to the estimated lifetime. The title of the window is "Lifetime Countdown. The countdown updates every second and displays the number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds remaining. This code defines the Clock class and creates the Tkinter Toplevel window and label in the init method. The update_clock method is also responsible for retrieving the current date and time, calculating the remaining time, and displaying it on the label.

The count function retrieves the date of birth and estimated lifespan entered by the user and creates an instance of the Clock class to start the lifespan countdown.

It also uses Tkinter to create a window and various widgets (labels, entry fields, and buttons) to accept input from the user.

Using this code, users can create a Lifespan Countdown app that allows them to track their own lifespan countdown.
